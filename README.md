# AR Product Preview App

**Augmented Reality - Product Preview with Hand Gesture Control**

This project enables users to preview e-commerce products in their physical environment using Augmented Reality (AR) on Android devices. It uses Unity3D with ARFoundation and integrates with cloud-based storage (FTP/Google Drive) to fetch and render 3D models of products. Users can interact with the product using hand gestures such as pinch (resize), swipe (rotate), and double tap (reposition).

## üß© Architecture

1. User opens the AR app.
2. Selects a product from the list.
3. The app downloads the respective 3D model.
4. Using AR SLAM + plane detection, a surface is identified.
5. On double tap, the product appears in the selected space.
6. User interacts with product via hand gestures.
